I am pursuing my master degree in [School of Data and Computer Science at Sun Yat-Sen University](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/) supvised by [Prof. Xu Chen](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/node/2497). Prior to joining SYSU, I was a member of [R&C Studio](https://scutrandc.github.io) supvised by [Dr. Weipeng Guan](https://kwanwaipang.github.io/) at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/new/) where I graduated from with B.Eng. specialized in Automation and B.A. as the second degree.

Research Interest
======
My current research interests mainly on edge computing, blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. My research interest in undergraduate was image communication and machine vision, especially for its application in the field of indoor visible light positioning.

Selected Publications
======
A full list of my publications in reverse chronological order can be found in [here](https://drenches.github.io/publications/).
